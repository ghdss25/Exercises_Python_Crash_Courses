## Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162).
## Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. Create an
## instance called restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the
## restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.
## Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number
## of customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and
## print the value again.
## Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
## the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served.
## Call this method with any number you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a
## day of business.

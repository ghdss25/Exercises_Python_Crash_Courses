## 10-6. Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input
## occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert
## the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError. Write a program that prompts for
## two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the ValueError if
## either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your
## program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a
## number

try:

      number1 = int(input("Selected first number: "))
      number2 = int(input("Selected second number: "))

      addition = number1 + number2

except ValueError:

      print("Sorry, can't data of string")

else:

      print(addition)

## 10-13. Verify User: The final listing for remember_me.py assumes either that the
## user has already entered their username or that the program is running for the
## first time. We should modify it in case the current user is not the person who
## last used the program. Before printing a welcome back message in greet_user(),
## ask the user if this is the correct username.
## If itâ€™s not, call get_new_username() to get the correct
## username.

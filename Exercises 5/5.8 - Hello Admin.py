## 5-8. Hello Admin: Make a list of one or more usernames, including the name
## 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user
## after they log in to a website. Loop through the list, and print a greeting to
## each user:

## If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin,
## would you like to see a status report?

## Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Jaden, thank you for logging in again.

list_admin = ["Gustavo"]

for admin in list_admin:

      if list_admin != "Gustavo":

            print("Hello", admin, "would you like to see a status report ?")

      else:
            
            print("Hello User", admin)

      if list_admin != "Henrique":

            print("Hello User Henrique")

      else:

            print("Hello Henrique would you like to see a status report ?")

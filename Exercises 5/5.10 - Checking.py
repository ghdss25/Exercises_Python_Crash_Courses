## 5-10. Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates
## how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username

## Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users

## Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or
## two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.

## Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already
## been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a
## new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying
## that the username is available.

## Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used,
## 'JOHN' should not be accepted. (To do this, youâ€™ll need to make a copy of
## current_users containing the lowercase versions of all existing users.

current_list = ['Henrique', 'Walter', 'Vanderson', 'Mariana', 'jonh']
new_users = ['Wallyson', 'Hunterllar', 'Vanderson', 'Mariana', 'Jonh']

## 5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
## describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
## should look something like this:

## Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
## evaluates to True or False

car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')

print()
print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')

## Because definition on print of logic where o first is True and other is False 

## Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and
## another five tests evaluate to False.

food = 'break'
print("\n food == break ? | predict True")
print(food == 'break')

print("")

print("Ferrari")
car1 = 'Ferrari'
print("Situacion: of Ferrari", car1.lower() == 'ferrari')

print("Horse")
animals = 'Horse'
print("Situacion: of Horse", animals.lower() == 'horse')

print('Scorpion')
animals1 = 'Scorpion'
print("Situacion: of Scorpion", animals.upper() == 'carnivore')

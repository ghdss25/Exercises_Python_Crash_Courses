## Write an if-elif-else chain that determines a person’s
## stage of life. Set a value for the variable age, and then:

## If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.
## If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.
## If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a kid.
## If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a teenager.
## If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that the person is an adult.
## If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.

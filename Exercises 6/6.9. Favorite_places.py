## Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three
## names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places
## for each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends
## to name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print
## each personâ€™s name and their favorite places

## 4-12. More Loops: All versions of foods.py in this section have avoided using
## for loops when printing to save space. Choose a version of foods.py, and
## write two for loops to print each list of foods.

foods = ['beef', 'break', 'apple', 'pizzas', 'bean', 'cheese']

for f in foods:

      print("Listing on the screen: ", f)

print("Printing the first elements on list on screen", foods[:3])

print("")

for fo in foods:

       print("Listing on the screen: ", fo)

print("Printing the last elements on list on screen", foods[3:])

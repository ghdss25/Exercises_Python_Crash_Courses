## 4-1. Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these
## pizza names in a list, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.

## Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza
## instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should
## have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni
## pizza.

print("What's your favorite pizzas? ")
pizzas = ['pepperoni', 'four cheeses', 'mozzarella', 'beef']

for p in pizzas:

      print("My favorite pizzas ", p)

print("") 
print("I really love pizza: ", pizzas[0])
print("I really love pizza: ", pizzas[1])
print("I really love pizza: ", pizzas[2])
print("I really love pizza: ", pizzas[3])
